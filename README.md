=========
Introducing the unbeaten []: "Tic-Tac-Toe Master"!

Featuring...

- Object-oriented JavaScript
- MVC design
- Sleek 1-page view
- Lightweight, client-side-only architecture
- Jasmine test suite
- Encouraging user messages before every match!

If you think you can beat the Master, give it a whirl!
But know this: the Master has played every possible sequence of moves on this board and has never lost.

Clone the repository and run the spec by visiting Jasmine's SpecRunner.html on your local browser. Check out the console log to see the breakdown of a MasterTest that recursively runs through every possible game sequence and logs the result.

Of the 585 possible sequences (many terminate by win before the board runs out), there are:
- 410 wins
- 175 draws
- 0 losses

If you think you can make a smarter Master, I'd love to hear from you!
